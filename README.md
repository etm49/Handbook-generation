# Handbook-generation EPI Demo

Automatically update statistical values in indicator analysis word docs

### Folder Structure
- **word doc/input** Analysis word docx documents to be read in by notebook (updated). Values to be updated should be in brackets. For instance, So the sentence:“Anguilla has the lowest index value in SIDS of 31.5, which is above the SIDS average index value of 27.5,” would be changed to: “{“ohi-index”,”minSids”, “countryName”} has the lowest index value of {“ohi-index”,”minSids”, “value”}, which is above the SIDS average index value of {“ohi-index”,”avePacific”, “value”}. 
- **word doc/ouputs** word docx documents generated by notebook

- **indicator data** folder for containing the indicatorData dataset and undpSids.json

- **Notebook** folder for experimental notebooks
	- *handbook generator.ipynb* notebook for generating first page of EPI analysis with updated statistical values. Codes for caluclating the values and outputs are defined in the notebook
